# Spam-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes
This project demonstrates how to build a Spam Detection Model using the Naive Bayes algorithm in Python. The model classifies messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on their content.  


## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `spam1.xls`
- Contains labeled messages for spam detection.
- Columns typically include:
  - **Label**: "spam" or "ham"
  - **Message**: Text content of the message

## 🚀 Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Text cleaning (removing special characters, converting to lowercase, etc.)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Training a **Naive Bayes** classifier
- Evaluating model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Visualization of classification results
